Chapter 2: this All Makes Sense Now!
------------------------------------
In Chapter 1, we discarded various misconceptions about this and learned instead that this is a binding made for each function invocation, based entirely on its call-site (how the function is called).

Call-site
==========
The call-site: the location in code where a function is called (not where it's declared). We must inspect the call-site to answer the question: what's this "this" a reference to?

Finding the call-site is generally: "go locate where a function is called from", but it's not always that easy, as certain coding patterns can obscure the true call-site.

What's important is to think about the call-stack (the stack of functions that have been called to get us to the current moment in execution). The call-site we care about is in the invocation before the currently executing function.
